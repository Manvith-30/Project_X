# Research Question

How can GenAI-powered chatbots enhance mental health support through conversational AI on Discord?

## Arguments

#### What is already known about this topic

* AI-driven chatbots can provide mental health support by engaging in empathetic conversations.
* Challenges include maintaining privacy, ensuring ethical AI use, and preventing misinformation.
* The integration of natural language processing (NLP) can improve chatbot understanding and responsiveness.

#### What this research is exploring

* We employ NLP and prompt engineering to create an emotionally supportive chatbot.
* We are building a mental health chatbot on Discord that can provide coping strategies, emotional support, and resource recommendations.
* We are exploring the effectiveness of AI-generated responses in reducing stress and anxiety in users.

#### Implications for practice

* It will be easier for individuals to access mental health support discreetly.
* It will optimize AI-driven mental health interactions, making them more empathetic and accurate.
* We will better understand how conversational AI can enhance mental health support and bridge gaps in mental healthcare access.

# Research Method

1. **Solution Ideation**: Define how the chatbot will support mental health conversations and provide useful resources.
2. **Requirement Analysis**: Identify and prioritize features such as emotional support, NLP-driven responses, and external resource integration.
3. **Development Platform**: Utilize the OwlMind framework to integrate Discord interactions and AI-driven conversations.
4. **Implementation Phases**:
   * v0.1: Basic Q&A interactions, emotional support responses.
   * v0.2: Coping strategy suggestions, API integration for mental health resources.
   * v0.3: Advanced NLP-based empathetic responses, escalation to human counselors.

# Results

* Initial implementation of the chatbot with basic emotional support functionalities.
