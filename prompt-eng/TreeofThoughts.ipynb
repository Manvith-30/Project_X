    "# Tree-of-Thought Prompting\n",
    "\n",
    "Tree-of-Thought (ToT) prompting is a technique that encourages models to break down problems into multiple reasoning paths, evaluate each independently, and select the best approach. This structured reasoning enhances decision-making and improves problem-solving capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "By allowing models to explore different thought processes before arriving at a conclusion, ToT helps generate more reliable and well-structured responses.\n",
