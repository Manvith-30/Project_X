    "# Debate Prompting\n",
    "\n",
    "Debate prompting is a technique where a model generates multiple perspectives on a topic and engages in a simulated debate. This approach helps in exploring diverse viewpoints, refining arguments, and reaching well-reasoned conclusions.\n",
    "\n",
    "By challenging different perspectives, debate prompting improves critical thinking and enhances the modelâ€™s ability to reason about complex topics.\n",

      "Moderator: Welcome to today's debate on mindfulness versus exercise for mental well-being. We have Dr. Maria, who advocates for the benefits of mindfulness, and Dr. Jack, who is a strong proponent of exercise as a key factor in maintaining mental health. Let's begin with our first speaker, Dr. Maria.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Maria: Thank you. Mindfulness practices such as meditation, deep breathing, and yoga have been consistently shown to reduce symptoms of anxiety and depression, improve emotional regulation, and enhance overall well-being. These techniques are accessible to anyone, regardless of age or physical ability, and can be incorporated into daily life in short, manageable moments.\n",
      "\n",
      "Moreover, regular mindfulness practice has been linked to lower stress levels, improved cognitive function, and even better relationships with others. It's not just about feeling more calm or relaxed; it's also about increasing our sense of self-awareness, clarity, and connection to ourselves and those around us.\n",
      "\n",
      "Many people find that adopting a regular mindfulness practice can have profound effects on both mental and emotional well-being. So whether you're looking to reduce stress, improve relationships, boost motivation, or cultivate a greater sense of calm and focus, integrating mindfulness into your daily routine is an excellent investment in your long-term happiness and well-being.\n",

      "To begin practicing mindfulness, it's recommended that you try activities such as:\n",
