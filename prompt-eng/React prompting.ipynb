    "# ReAct Prompting\n",
    "\n",
    "ReAct (Reasoning + Acting) prompting is a technique that combines reasoning with step-by-step action-taking. Instead of just generating answers, the model actively reasons through the problem and determines necessary actions before responding.\n",
    "\n",
    "This method improves the depth and reliability of responses by encouraging the model to reason before answering, leading to more accurate and insightful results.\n",

      "1. **Gratitude Practice**: Focus on cultivating gratitude by maintaining a journal or writing down three things you're thankful for each day.\n",
      "2. **Self-Care Routine**: Establish a daily routine that includes activities that bring you joy, relaxation, and fulfillment, such as meditation, exercise, or reading.\n",
      "3. **Meaningful Connection**: Nurture deep connections with loved ones by prioritizing quality time together, scheduling regular check-ins, and showing genuine interest in each other's lives.\n",
      "4. **Purpose and Passions**: Pursue your passions and values-driven work to find purpose, a sense of fulfillment, and happiness that goes beyond financial success.\n",
      "5. **Growth and Development**: Continuously learn, adapt, and evolve to stay challenged, engaged, and open to new opportunities.\n",
      "6. **Community and Connections**: Nurture relationships with supportive people who care about your well-being and celebrate your achievements.\n",
      "7. **Balance and Self-Care**: Prioritize your physical and emotional health by making time for activities that bring you joy, relaxation, and fulfillment.\n",
      "8. **Personal Growth and Goals**: Set and work towards long-term objectives, acknowledging setbacks and learning from experiences.\n",
